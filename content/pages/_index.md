Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my little place on the internet where I write about things I find interesting and share my thoughts with others like you.

I am a security researcher with a strong focus on malware reverse engineering. I co-maintain the open-source reverse engineering frameworks [Rizin](https://rizin.re) and [Cutter](https://cutter.re).

Most of my free time is dedicated for political and social activism and in general pursuing of what I see as just. I am an animal liberation activist and [vegan](/vegan). I read a lot, I'm a non-stop learner and Iâ€™ll always jump on an opportunity to solve a good challenge. Try me.
