## $ WHOAMI

Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Itay Cohen. I've been fascinated by computers for as long as I can remember. Over time, I developed a fascination with cybersecurity and started teaching myself about hacking, reverse engineering and malware analysis. Most of my free time is dedicated for political and social activism and in general pursuing of what I see as just. I am an animal liberation activist and vegan. I read a lot, Iâ€™m a non-stop learner and Iâ€™ll always jump on an opportunity to solve a good challenge.


## VEGANISM


I am vegan since late 2013 after one moment of clear thinking. I had the courage and the decancy to confront the hard truth - I was participating in needless acts of violence against animals, just for the sake of my own pleasure and convenience.

  > _The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men.
  Just how destructive does a culinary preference have to be before we decide to eat something else? If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be? If being the number one contributor to the most serious environmental threat facing the planet isn't enough, what is? And if you are tempted to put off these questions of conscience, to say not now, then when? (Alice Walker and Jonathan S. Foer)_
