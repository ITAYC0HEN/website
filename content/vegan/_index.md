## Why I am vegan and why you should consider it too.

I am vegan since late 2013 after one moment of clear thinking. I had the courage and the decency to confront the hard truth - I was participating in needless acts of violence against animals, just for the sake of my own pleasure and convenience.

  > _The animals of the world exist for their own reasons. They were not made for humans any more than black people were made for white, or women created for men.
  Just how destructive does a culinary preference have to be before we decide to eat something else? If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be? If being the number one contributor to the most serious environmental threat facing the planet isn't enough, what is? And if you are tempted to put off these questions of conscience, to say not now, then when?  
  — (Alice Walker and Jonathan S. Foer)_



Every year, billions of sentient beings are bred into existence only to live short, miserable lives and die in horrific ways - all for products we don't need. These animals feel pain, fear, and suffering just as we do.

There is no moral justification for causing unnecessary suffering to others. When we have the choice to live without harming animals, choosing to harm them is a moral failure.
