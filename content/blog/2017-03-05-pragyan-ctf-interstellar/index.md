We are given with a photo, I opened it in Photoshop and saw that parts of it are transparent.

<img src="./Interstellar_transmission.png" /> 

&nbsp;

I grabbed Python and removed the Alpha layer from the image. The Alpha layer controls pixels&#8217; transparency.

```python
from PIL import Image
Image.open('transmission.png').convert('RGB').save('output.png')
```


We got the result with the flag:

<img src="./2output-1.png" />

The flag wasÂ **pragyanctf{Cooper_Brand}**
